# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal Node.js sandbox project for testing Claude Code functionality. The project includes only the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` dependency and serves as a clean environment for experimenting with Claude Code features.

## Common Commands

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm test` - Currently returns an error as no tests are configured

## Development Notes

This is a sandbox environment with no established architecture or build processes. When adding new functionality, consider the project's purpose as a testing ground for Claude Code capabilities.
